Load balancing is a technique used in distributed computing to distribute computational workloads across multiple nodes or servers in a network. The goal of load balancing is to ensure that no single node or server becomes overwhelmed with too much work while other nodes are idle or underutilized.

In a distributed computing environment, a load balancer acts as a mediator between the clients that make requests and the servers that process those requests. When a client sends a request, the load balancer determines which server is best suited to handle the request based on factors such as the current workload of each server, the location of the client, and the type of request being made.

Load balancing can be implemented using different algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, or IP hash. These algorithms use different criteria to decide how to distribute the workloads. For example, a round-robin algorithm distributes the workloads evenly among the available servers in a cyclic order, while a least connections algorithm assigns new requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

Overall, load balancing helps to optimize the performance, scalability, and availability of distributed computing systems by ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed across the network.
