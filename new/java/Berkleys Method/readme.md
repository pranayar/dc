Berkley's method is a clock synchronization algorithm used in distributed computing to synchronize the clocks of different nodes in a network. In distributed systems, nodes often have different local clocks, which can lead to inconsistencies in the ordering of events and other issues.

The basic idea behind Berkeley's method is to have one node act as a time server, which periodically broadcasts its current time to all other nodes in the network. Each node then compares its local clock with the time server's clock and adjusts its clock accordingly.

The algorithm works as follows:

- The time server broadcasts its current time to all nodes in the network.
- Each node receives the time from the time server and calculates the difference between its local clock and the time server's clock.
- Each node then adjusts its local clock by the calculated difference.
- The algorithm can be repeated periodically to keep the clocks synchronized.

This method is known as a "soft" clock synchronization method because the clocks are not adjusted all at once, but rather gradually over time. This allows the clocks to be synchronized without causing sudden jumps or disruptions in the system.

Berkley's method is a relatively simple and efficient clock synchronization algorithm that has been widely used in distributed systems. However, it does have some limitations, such as the assumption that the time server is reliable and accurate, and the fact that it does not account for network delays or other sources of clock skew.

### Code

In this example, we have a `Node` class that represents a node in the network, with an `{ID, clock value, and offset}`. The `synchronizeClocks` method receives a list of nodes, and it calculates the offset for each node by comparing its clock value with the time server's clock value. It then adjusts each node's clock by the calculated offset.

The `main` method creates three nodes with different clock offsets, and it calls the `synchronizeClocks` method to synchronize their clocks. Finally, it prints the updated clock values for each node.

Note that this implementation uses the current system time in seconds as the initial clock value for each node. In a real system, the initial clock value would typically be obtained from a more accurate source, such as an NTP server. Also, in a real system, the network delays and other sources of clock skew would need to be taken into account.
