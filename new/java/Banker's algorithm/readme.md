The Banker's algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in distributed computing systems to prevent deadlocks when multiple processes request resources. The algorithm is used by a central resource allocation system or a process manager to ensure that requests for resources do not result in deadlock.

In this algorithm, the system maintains a record of the maximum number of resources that each process can request, the number of resources currently available, and the number of resources currently allocated to each process.

When a process requests a resource, the system checks whether granting the request will result in a deadlock. If the request can be granted without causing a deadlock, the system allocates the resource to the process. If the request cannot be granted without causing a deadlock, the process is blocked until the resource becomes available.

To determine whether granting a request will result in a deadlock, the system uses a safety algorithm that checks whether there is a sequence of processes that can request resources and release them in such a way that all processes can complete. If such a sequence exists, the system grants the request. Otherwise, the request is denied.

The Banker's algorithm works well for small systems where the number of resources is limited and the system can keep track of all the requests and allocations. However, for large systems, the algorithm may be too complex to implement and may not be efficient. In addition, the algorithm assumes that the maximum number of resources that a process can request is known in advance, which may not be feasible in some distributed computing systems.

### Code explanation

The program takes user inputs for the allocation matrix, max matrix, and available matrix, which are used to calculate the need matrix. The check method checks whether a requested resource is available or not, and the isSafe method uses a loop to allocate resources until all processes are allocated or it becomes impossible to allocate resources without causing a deadlock.

Overall, the program follows the basic steps of the Banker's algorithm, including calculating the need matrix, checking for available resources, and determining whether the system can remain in a safe state.
