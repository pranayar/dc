'''
Distributed global averaging is a method used in distributed computing where multiple machines or nodes collaborate to compute an average value. 
The goal of this method is to compute an average of a large dataset that is too big to be processed by a single machine. Each node holds a subset of the dataset and computes a local average. 
The local averages are then combined to compute the global average, which is the final result.
In simple terms, if you have a large dataset that you want to average but your computer can't handle it, you can break the dataset into smaller pieces and distribute them among multiple computers. 
Each computer can then calculate the average of their piece of the dataset and send it back to a central node, which can then calculate the overall average of the entire dataset.

In the above code, we are simulating a distributed computing scenario where we have multiple nodes or machines, each holding a subset of a dataset. The goal is to compute the global average of the entire dataset by combining the local averages of each node.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

We define the number of nodes (num_nodes) and the size of the dataset (data_size). For simplicity, we assume that each node holds a subset of the dataset of the same size.

We generate random data for each node using NumPy's random.rand() function. Each node's data is stored in a separate NumPy array in the data list.

We define the learning rate (learning_rate) and the number of iterations (num_iterations) that we want to run the distributed global averaging algorithm for. We also initialize the global model (global_model) to be an array of zeros.

We enter the main loop of the algorithm, which runs for num_iterations iterations. For each iteration:

a. We update the local model for each node by subtracting the difference between the local model and the global model from the local model, scaled by the learning rate. This is done using the following line of code:
local_model -= learning_rate * (local_model - global_model)

This step is important because it ensures that each node's local model is influenced by the global model, but not too much. The learning rate controls how much influence the global model has on the local model.

b. We compute the new global model by averaging the local models using NumPy's mean() function. This is done using the following line of code:
global_model = np.mean(data, axis=0)

This step combines the local models from all the nodes to produce a new global model that represents the average of the entire dataset.

c. We print the current iteration number and the global model using the following line of code:
print("Iteration:", i+1, "Global Model:", global_model)

d. We sleep for a short time using the time.sleep() function to simulate computation time. This is done using the following line of code:
time.sleep(0.1)

After the loop is finished, the final global model should be a good approximation of the global average of the dataset.
